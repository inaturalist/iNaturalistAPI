    # https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/

    [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) is a global community of
    naturalists, scientists, and members of the public sharing over a million
    wildlife sightings to teach one another about the natural world while
    creating high quality citizen science data for science and conservation.
    The iNaturalist technology infrastructure and open source software is
    administered by the
    [California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/) as
    part of their mission to explore, explain, and sustain life on Earth.

    These API methods return data in JSON/JSONP and PNG response formats. They
    are meant to supplement the existing [iNaturalist
    API](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference), implemented in Ruby
    on Rails, which has more functionality and supports more write operations,
    but tends to be slower and have less consistent response formats. Visit our
    [developers page](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/developers) for more
    information. Write operations that expect and return JSON describe a single
    `body` parameter that represents the request body, which should be specified
    as JSON. See the "Model" of each body parameter for attributes that we
    accept in these JSON objects.

    Multiple values for a single URL parameter should be separated by commas,
    e.g. `taxon_id=1,2,3`.

    Map tiles are generated using the
    [node-mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik) library, following the
    XYZ map tiling scheme. The "Observation Tile" methods accept nearly all the
    parameters of the observation search APIs, and will generate map tiles
    reflecting the same observations returned by searches. These
    "Observation Tile" methods have corresponding
    [UTFGrid](https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec) JSON
    responses which return information needed to make interactive maps.

    Authentication in the Node API is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT). To
    obtain one, make an [OAuth-authenticated
    request](http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#auth) to
    https://www.inaturalist.org/users/api_token. Each JWT will expire after 24
    hours. Authentication required for all PUT and POST requests. Some GET
    requests will also include private information like hidden coordinates if
    the authenticated user has permission to view them.

    ## Terms of Use

    Use of this API is subject to the iNaturalist
    [Terms of Service](https://www.inaturalist.org/terms) and
    [Privacy Policy](https://www.inaturalist.org/privacy). We will block any
    use of our API that violates our Terms or Privacy Policy without notice.
    The API is intended to support application development, not data scraping.
    For pre- generated data exports, see
    https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/developers.

    Please note that we throttle API usage to a max of 100 requests per minute,
    though we ask that you try to keep it to 60 requests per minute or lower,
    and to keep under 10,000 requests per day. If we notice usage that has
    serious impact on our performance we may institute blocks without
    notification.

        Update an identification. Note that to "withdraw" an observation you
        send a `PUT` request to this endpoint and set the `current`
        attribute to false. To "restore" it you do the same but set
        `current` to `true`. Only one identification by a given user can be
        `current` for a given observation, so if you "restore" one all the other
        identifications by the authenticated user for the given observation will
        be withdrawn.
